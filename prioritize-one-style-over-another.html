<!--
I learned how making a class and applying the styling of the class on an element actually overrides the styling that was already defined in the body.
-->
<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text{
    color: pink;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text"> Hello World!</h1>
