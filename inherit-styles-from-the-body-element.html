<!--
I learned to see how applying a style to body will be inherited by all the elements inside body of HTML and also how you can set a background color as a whole and then change color of text to another color on that background color.

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: green;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
  
</style>

<h1> Hello World </h1>
